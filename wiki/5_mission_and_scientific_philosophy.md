## Views on Energy, Resources, and Science
Access to minimum energy, clean water, quality education, and clean living, even today, remains a distant dream for nearly 1.1 billion individuals by UN estimates. That people still live in wretched conditions of no power despite extravagant power consumption elsewhere, is unfortunate. As kids, we used to have regular power-cuts back in my hometown in India, and I would often get vexed at just an hour’s power-outage. Now when I look back at it, it is unimaginable to see the plight of people who live under perennial darkness. An individual should, at any time, at any place, have the capability to meet one’s own energy needs, without being subject to governmental, societal, or physical constraints. That, is my firm belief. My broad interests thus lie in anything that facilitate this ‘self-sustenance’ through efficient semiconductor and energy systems that are achieved from such material, process, science, and engineering innovations.

Science, engineering, art and sport are, to me, major avenues to bring about larger emotional harmony and peace, and creative forms of personal liberation. I mention art because it has a special role to play in human thought. When Covid struck and science to a major extent in most institutions and universities had come to a standstill, it was actually art and sports that brought people together. They are fundamental to who we are as humans. The wide reach and the collective unity they bring about among all of us is especially needed in the trying times right now. As a materials enthusiast, this website is an attempt at popularizing a fun approach towards materials science and deconvoluting some mechanisms behind their working. I have plans to expand this to be more accessible that have not materialized yet, but have some exciting developments so watch out for this space! If nothing at best, just take a look and have fun!

This site is dedicated to all those interested in this pursuit.
