<p style="font-size:30px; color:#000000;"><i>Electromagnetics, Optics and Photonics:</i></p>

### Coming up soon

#### Overview
Plan to put everything I've learnt and am trying to learn about over here in a bottom-up approach to science. This will be more math-heavy but trying to simplify the math behing classical, quantum mechanics and with a particular focus on electromagnetic waves and their real-world implications.

#### 1. Electons and Photons

#### 2. What's in a wave?

#### 3. Packets or particles?

#### 4. Wavefunctions

#### 5. The Schrodinger equation, or maybe not

#### 6. The Particle in a box model

#### 7. 1D, 2D, and 3D

#### 8. Bounds, Constraints and Quantization

#### 9.
